Description:

Objective:

The goal of this project is to design and simulate a simple 4-stage pipelined processor using Verilog HDL. The processor supports basic instructions like ADD, SUB, and LOAD, and operates on 8-bit data. Pipelining is a fundamental concept in computer architecture that allows multiple instructions to be executed in overlapping stages, significantly increasing throughput and performance. This mini-project is designed to provide a practical understanding of how instruction execution is broken down into stages and how data flows through a pipelined architecture.

The pipeline stages include:

Instruction Fetch (IF) – retrieves the instruction from memory.

Instruction Decode (ID) – decodes the instruction and reads register values.

Execute (EX) – performs arithmetic or memory access.

Memory/Write Back (MEM/WB) – writes result back to register file.


 Tools Used:
 
Verilog HDL: Used to describe the digital logic design of the processor, including instruction decoding, ALU logic, register file, and memory control.

Icarus Verilog (iverilog): An open-source simulator used to compile and simulate Verilog files.

GTKWave: A waveform viewer used to analyze signal transitions and verify pipelined execution.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A modern code editor used for writing Verilog modules and organizing project files.

 Applications:
 
Computer Architecture Labs: Ideal for illustrating pipelined CPU execution.

Embedded System Prototyping: Basic structure of how instruction sets execute in MCUs or processors.

Custom Processor Design: A good starting point for building application-specific instruction processors (ASIPs).

VLSI Design Projects: Demonstrates RTL modeling of processors for ASIC or FPGA development.

Academic Mini Projects: Simple and effective pipeline demonstration for undergraduate coursework.

Conclusion:

The 4-stage pipelined processor project demonstrates how simple instructions can be executed efficiently through instruction pipelining. It provides valuable insights into instruction flow, timing, and data dependency management. Using Verilog HDL for simulation, along with visualization in GTKWave, helped verify functional correctness and timing coordination between pipeline stages. This project not only deepens understanding of digital logic and processor design but also serves as a stepping stone for more advanced CPU and system-on-chip (SoC) design projects.
